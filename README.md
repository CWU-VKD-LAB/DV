# DV

## About

This application displays n-Dimensional data in 2D using General Line Coordinates Linear (GLC-L) then visualizes the results as Hyper Blocks using CUDA for optimization.

## Features

- For better class separation, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to get the optimal angles and threshold for a visualization.
- Adjustments to the angles and threshold can be done by using the related slider.
- Graphs produced by this program can be panned, zoomed in/out, and scaled.
- Graph order can be rearranged.
- Analytics generated by this program include the "All Data," "Data Without Overlap," "Overlap Data," and "Worst Case," confusion matrices as well as k-fold cross validation.

Please refer to the user manual for specifics on any of the information above.

### Dataset Information

- Dataset must be in .csv format
- Dataset must include a header row
- If there is an ID column, it must be first
- If there is a class column it must be last
- Dataset features besides "class" must be numeric

### Example Dataset

### Requirements

- Java 17 - [download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- Windows

### Install and Run

1. Clone repository and open in explorer
2. Open "run" directory
3. Unzip DV.zip
4. Run "DV.exe"
5. Follow instructions in "Run Instructions" for additional help

### Build and Run from Source

1. Clone repository and open as project in Intellij IDE
2. Build project
3. Run

### Generic build instructions

1. Clone repository
2. Run from root directory to compile: `javac -cp "lib/*:src" src/*.java src/Sliders/*.java`
3. Run from root directory to run: `java -cp "lib/*:src" Main`

This method requires the use of the `lib` directory for libraries, this can be manually updated to fit your system should a specific dependency version be required.
